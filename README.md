# Paygrade-prediction
A Dataset was downloded from Kaggle.com about the Paygrade of different jobs and the job class each stands for.
Each job is defined with a specific paygrade, and this paygrade is affected by the Data: EducationLevel,Experience,OrgImpact,ProblemSolving,Supervision,ContactLevel,FinancialBudget.
The Datatset was checked and cleaned from any nulls.
The Categorical Data was changed to Numerical Data.
The AI was splitted to Train and Test with the percents 70% and 30% respectively.
Libraries imported: Numpy,Pamdas,Seaborn,and Sklearn.
After training was compeleted, we provided the the system with random Dataentries to test for accuracy.
Classification Alogarithims was used to determine which alogarithm has the highest prediction rate.
Decision Trees and Naive Bayes gave the best results.
Other methods used to test for accuracy: Logistic Regression, and KNN(k-nearest neighbor).
